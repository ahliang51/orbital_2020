Orbital (Independent Software Development Project) is NUS School of Computing self-directed, independent work course. This programme gives students the opportunity to pick up software development skills on their own, using sources on the web.

## Problem
Whenever trading financial instruments (stocks, currencies), the user will need to make an informed decision through the usage of technical indicators which are often laborious and time-intensive. The user will need to open up their exchange platforms and set up indicators to look for trends in the stock market for each of the different instruments. Furthermore, certain markets are opened at different points in the day, sometimes operating at times where the average retail investor is asleep. Hence, missing out opportunities due to the time difference. Furthermore, as retail investors are starting out, most of their trades will be biased due to their emotional sentiment attached to each trade and affecting their experience when it comes to investing.

## Solution
A trading bot that can automatically make trades on your behalf.

Through constant monitoring of financial instruments’ prices using a mixture of technical indicators, we can send a trading signal to our bot to automatically execute the trade on the user’s behalf as it fulfills the requirements of certain technical indicators. In addition, we intend to create our own indicator using machine learning based on historical prices to predict future prices. Additionally, having the trading process automated removes any emotional sentiments attached to each trade allowing the user to have a more unvarnished view of his trading process.

## Technical Indicators

Our Application will host various technicals:
1. ADX (Average Directional Index)
2. ATR (Average True Range)
3. Bollinger Bands
4. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
5. OBV (On-Balance Volume)
6. RSI (Relative Strength Index)
6. Renko Chart Type

All these are commonly used technical indicators by retail investors who frequent technical indicators.

## APIs used (to be used)

1. Alpha-Vantage API
2. Tradier-API
3. Python (Numpy, pandas, sci-kit Learn) # NUS Orbital 2020 (TeamName: IndoMie)
